# Changelog

All notable changes to OPC Skills are documented here.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Skill Compatibility & Dependency Matrix

Each skill maintains its own independent version. Use this matrix to understand dependencies and compatibility.

| Skill | Current Version | Requires | Min Versions |
|-------|-----------------|----------|--------------|
| **requesthunt** | 2.3.0 | - | - |
| **domain-hunter** | 1.0.0 | twitter, reddit | twitter ≥1.0.0, reddit ≥1.0.0 |
| **logo-creator** | 1.0.0 | nanobanana | nanobanana ≥1.0.0 |
| **banner-creator** | 1.0.0 | nanobanana | nanobanana ≥1.0.0 |
| **nanobanana** | 1.0.0 | - | - |
| **reddit** | 1.0.0 | - | - |
| **twitter** | 1.0.0 | - | - |
| **producthunt** | 1.0.0 | - | - |
| **seo-geo** | 1.0.0 | twitter, reddit | twitter ≥1.0.0, reddit ≥1.0.0 |
| **archive** | 1.1.0 | - | - |

**Key Points:**
- Each skill has an independent version number (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Skills can be released independently without coordinating with others
- Use this matrix to identify dependencies before updating a skill
- When a dependency skill updates with breaking changes, dependent skills need to be tested
